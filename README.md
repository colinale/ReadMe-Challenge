[How to create a Professional README](https://coding-boot-camp.github.io/full-stack/github/professional-readme-guide)


During this challenge I had the opportunity to learn a lot about back server JS and learn how to create a readme file. This is one of the toughest challenges we've had so far, but with the help of my tutor and TA's I was able to overcome certain obsticles that were holding me back from progressing. I was able to build a readme file based on the requirements that we're being asked of and see how files are created on the backend. I really enjoyed this weeks challenge because it feels like everything is slowly coming together while still giving a great challenge. Learning more in depth information is really progressing my knowledge and helping me understand things I wasn't understanding in previous weeks. I definitely struggled a lot with javascript and other components within JS, but I can tell I'm understanding it much better than I was a few weeks ago.
